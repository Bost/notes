* Server Racket
** Servlet:
(HTTP Server) function: input HTTP request -> output HTTP response

Signature: request? → response?

Web App = Single large servlet

struts-copy for rewriting HTTP requests / responses

HTTP HEAD request - like a GET request but it returns no body
- used to determine how big a resource would be with a real GET request
