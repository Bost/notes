  RDE feature - a building block of RDE configuration.

  RDE consists of:
  1. Configuration Framework CF
     CF provides Feature, which is a record (a list of key-value pairs)
     consisting of 3 parts: values, home-services, system-services the values
     are shared across the features

  sharing values among services is hard using guix service extension mechanism

  features can provide home-service and system-service getters
     (which allows to use:)

    # full freeze of Guix channels to the versions defined in 'channels.scm'

  Use rde as a Channel:
  Advanced users may prefer to use only parts of rde they are interested:
  features, services, or just packages. In that case add the following channel
  to channels.scm.
  @lisp{
    (cons*
     (channel
      (name 'rde)
