  FHE Fully Homomorphic Encryption - Computations on encrypted data:
  Traditionally, an app needs to decrypt the data, perform some computation on
  the clear data, and re-encrypt the data. FHE removes the need for
  decryption-encryption steps. FHE-Computations on encrypted data is still
  orders of magnitude slower than performing the computation on the plaintext.
  (April 2023) Converting a program that operates on unencrypted data to one
  that operates on encrypted data is non-trivial. If not properly done, it can
  significantly increase the performance gap between computing on unencrypted
  data and the FHE-computation on encrypted data.

  TOFU Trust on first / TUFU trust Upon First Use:
  Authentication scheme used by client software which needs to establish a trust
  relationship with an unknown or not-yet-trusted endpoint

  Downgrade / Roll-Back Attacks:
  Trick users into installing older, known-vulnerable software packages.
  There is no way to answer the general question "is X the latest commit of
  branch B ?". Rollback detection prevents just rollbacks, but there's no
  mechanism in place to tell whether a given mirror is stale.

  TUF The Update Framework:
  https://theupdateframework.io/
  Helps developers maintain the security of software update systems, providing
  protection even against attackers that compromise the repository or signing
  keys. TUF provides a flexible framework and specification that developers can
  adopt into any software update system.
  Goals: provide means to minimize the impact of key compromise.

  pinentry:
  collection of dialog programs that allow GnuPG to read passphrases and PIN
  numbers in a secure manner. There are versions for the common GTK, Qt and the
  text terminal (Curses).

  public key fingerprint:
  short sequence of bytes used to identify a longer public key created by
  applying a cryptographic hash function to a public key. Fingerprints are
  shorter than the keys they refer to, they can be used to simplify certain key
  management tasks.

  @block{@block-name{gpg explained}
    `gpg key (structure)` is better than `ssh` and `gpg-agent` is better than
    `ssh-agent` GPG key structure: https://youtu.be/4-Ks_f8rQFA?t=370

    Prefer using gpg keys (over ssh keys) for github-related tasks, i.e. signing
    commits and tags, encrypting passwords and authenticating on remote servers.
    It is easier to maintain only one gpg key.

    gpg-agent:
    Secret key management for GnuPG, can emulate ssh-agent

@block{@block-name{DNS leak}
  When using an anonymity or privacy service:
  All traffic originating from your computer must be routed through the
  anonymity network. If any traffic leaks outside of the secure connection to
  the network, any adversary monitoring your traffic will be able to log your
  activity.
}

@block{@block-name{DNS and IP requests}
  The browser will send a clear text unencrypted DNS request to some DNS servers
  asking basically "So whatâ€™s the IP address of www.someserver.com?".

  Even in an incognito Window, using HTTPS and using a private or your own DNS
  service

  The ISP can tamper with the DNS responses even if you are using a private DNS.
  (Man-in-the-middle) Rendering the use of a private DNS service useless.

  Many devices and apps (Smart TVs 70%, Game Consoles 46%) will use hardcoded
  DNS servers bypassing any system setting you could set. For these devices,
  you will have to force them to stop using their hardcoded DNS service which
  could make them stop working properly.

  A solution: encrypted DNS using DoH (DNS over HTTPS38), DoT (DNS over TLS39)
  with a private DNS server (this can be self-hosted locally with a solution
  like pi-hole, remotely hosted with a solution like nextdns.io or using the
  solutions provider by your VPN provider or the Tor network). This should
  prevent your ISP or some go-between from snooping on your requests... except
  it might not help.

  .onion pages

  Anonymization - Tor implements Onion Routing Protocol, which works essentially
  as a proxy.

  Encrypted connections bounced / hopped around different routers are difficult
  to track. There are typically 3 hops
  Intermediate nodes - handle only encrypted messages
  Exit nodes - handle fully decrypted messages
  Any node in the tor-network knows only what's before and after them when
  forwarding connections.
  Multiple message encryption
  The client, i.e. the first computer / initial node creates a circuit:
  Establishes a shared key with the next node and instructed the other nodes to
  do the say right up to the request destination

  Unsolwable weaknes of Tor:
  If someone controls the entry and exit node(s) the he or she can see
  everything, via colerating messages, e.g. their timestamps on the entry and
  exit nodes.

  A Cell is a Tor message, it has 512 bytes. Any cell must indistinguishable
  from any other cell.
